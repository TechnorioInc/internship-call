* The design should be clean, eye-catching and minimalistic which must enhance the brand awareness. 
* It also needs to generally symbolize diversity, unity and pushing boundaries using basic circular shapes, oblong shapes and elements in relation to the product. We are open to additional artistic input and images that boost this symbolism.
